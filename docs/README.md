This is the primary GTG Project Structure. Whenever creating a new project, this structure can be used for starting off.

## Configuration

Firstly, go to the env.sample.ini file, copy its contents and create a new file called env.ini, and paste there. 
Then, complete the variables (app information, database, smtp configurations, etc.).

Then, go to the database folder and execute in your database schema db.sql contents, and then the factory.sql contents. 
After that, you're ready to start off.
